In the project we'll develop a multi-language application designed for online selling of Wayuu handcrafted products, where the user can navigate through the sections of the page displaying the products offered there. In turn you can check features, prices, see various images of the product and payment options available. Each customer will have the option to rate and review products and create a user account allowing them to save the state of their "shopping cart". The product will also feature a product finder with the possibility to filter them by price, ranking, alphabetically, news and / or popularity. The application administrator can add or remove products from the catalog, modify characteristics of each, access the inventory and the list of orders to be sent. In turn, the application will manage inventory and delivery orders.
